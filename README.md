This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
# Noticon
Noticon, is a humble imitation (for the time being, trying to be), of the well known Notion - as you might have already guessed from the name.

##Tech Stack
This project is built using:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Convex
- BlockNote

For the initial part, codebase actually refers to [CodeWithAntonio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OaDyjB9Ib8). But changes have been made at certain points and on further additions on the project.

##Further Additions
Further additions to the project have been planned using relevant information from Notion users, obtained through online forums and user interviews. These additions will be made as soon as possible!

## Getting Started

First, install the required dependencies by running 
```bash
npm install

npm run dev
# or
